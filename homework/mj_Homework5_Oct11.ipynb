Show that this timescale corresponds to the time that it takes for light to diffuse, in a random walk, through an expanding shell of gas. The shell has a mass $M=1.4M_{sun}$, a constant expansion velocity of $v=3\\times 10^4$ km/s, and an atomic-line opacity of $\\kappa \\approx 0.3$ cm$^2$/g. Thus, the \"light-curve rise time\" is just the time it takes for the radioactive decay luminosity from the entire shell to become visible.
